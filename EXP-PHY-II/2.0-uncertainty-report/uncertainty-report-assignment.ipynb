        "The precise measurement and analysis of physical quantities are fundamental aspects of experimental physics, as they allow us to understand the underlying principles governing natural phenomena. In this report, we focus on the study of uncertainties associated with the measurement of the period of a pendulum and the subsequent determination of the local gravitational acceleration. The experimental method involved measuring the length of a simple pendulum and recording the time taken for multiple oscillations using a stopwatch. Several sets of measurements were taken for different numbers of oscillations (1, 5, 7, 9, and 10), and the period was calculated by dividing the total time by the number of oscillations in each case, all the data were taken at Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia. By performing repeated measurements and applying statistical methods, we aim to quantify both random and systematic errors, thereby improving the reliability of our experimental results. This approach not only enhances our comprehension of measurement techniques but also underscores the importance of uncertainty analysis in scientific experimentation. The idea is also to compare the data extracted from the analysis, specifically from the calculus of the gravitational acceleration, and compare it with the current best approximation of the gravity in Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia done by Servicio Geológico Colombiano (Estaciones Red de Gravedad Absoluta Para Colombia -RGAC-, 2024)."

        "The period of a simple pendulum is governed by the relationship $$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$$ where $T$  is the period, $l$ is the length of the pendulum, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Accurate determination of $g$ requires careful measurement of both $l$ and $T$, as well as a thorough analysis of the uncertainties involved. Uncertainties can arise from instrumental limitations, human reaction time, and random fluctuations in repeated measurements. The propagation of these uncertainties is essential for reporting meaningful results and for comparing experimental findings with theoretical predictions. The methodology and significance of uncertainty analysis in experimental physics are well documented in the literature, such as in the \"Notas de Física Experimental\" by Edgar Rueda (Notas de Física Experimental — Notas de Física Experimental, 2022) as well as in the book by professor Jorge Mahecha (TratamientoEstadísticoDeDatosExperimentales, 2009)\n"

For practical purposes of the activity, multiple measurements of the pendulum length were not taken. However, ideally this should be done in order to produce a more complete uncertainty report for the estimated gravitational acceleration obtained from the period and length data of the pendulum. This is due to the dependence of gravity on both the pendulum length and its period, as shown in the following process:\n",

        "The experimental measurements of the pendulum oscillation period gave consistent results across all trials, the oscillation times were recorded for 1, 5, 7, 9, and 10 oscillations, and by dividing each measurement by the corresponding number of oscillations, the individual period values were obtained. The average period values for each oscillation set were: 1.60 s (1 oscillation), 1.76 s (5 oscillations), 1.75 s (7 oscillations), 1.77 s (9 oscillations), and 1.76 s (10 oscillations). After combining all 25 period measurements and performing statistical analysis, the best estimate of the pendulum period was determined to be $T = (1.73 \\pm 0.02)$ seconds, where the total uncertainty accounts for both the standard uncertainty of the mean and the stopwatch resolution (0.01 s). The statistical table analysis demonstrated that as the sample size increases from 5 to 30 measurements, the mean stabilizes around 1.73 s while the total uncertainty decreases, confirming the benefit of repeated measurements. Using the measured pendulum length of $l = (73.6 \\pm 0.1)$ cm and the calculated period, the gravitational acceleration was determined to be $g = 9.71 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$. \n",

        "Two methods were employed for uncertainty propagation: the elementary uncertainty theory using extreme values gave $g = (9.71 \\pm 1.02) \\, \\text{m/s}^2$, while the partial derivatives method gave a much smaller uncertainty of $\\Delta g = 0.15 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$, resulting in $g = (9.71 \\pm 0.15) \\, \\text{m/s}^2$. The expected gravity value for Medellín, calculated using the latitude (6.2°) and altitude (1464 m above sea level), was found to be approximately 9.78 m/s². The relative error between the experimentally calculated gravity and the expected value was approximately 0.7%, while the RGAC reference value of 9.77741092 m/s² showed an even smaller discrepancy with the theoretical prediction."

        "# Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment successfully demonstrated the application of uncertainty analysis techniques in the determination of gravitational acceleration using a simple pendulum. The results confirm that repeated measurements are essential for obtaining reliable estimates of physical quantities, as they allow the calculation of statistical measures such as the mean, standard deviation, and standard uncertainty, which together provide a comprehensive picture of measurement precision. The analysis revealed that the uncertainty associated with the period measurement dominates the overall uncertainty in the calculated gravitational acceleration, as shown by the partial derivatives propagation method where the contribution from $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} \\cdot \\Delta T$ is significantly larger than that from $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial l} \\cdot \\Delta l$. This finding underscores the importance of minimizing timing errors in pendulum experiments, which can be achieved by measuring multiple oscillations and dividing by the number of cycles, as well as by maintaining consistent experimental conditions. The comparison between the two uncertainty propagation methods highlighted that the elementary theory using extreme values tends to overestimate the uncertainty when outliers are present in the data, whereas the partial derivatives method provides a more refined estimate by considering only small, random fluctuations around the best estimate values. The experimentally obtained gravitational acceleration of $g = 9.71 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$ showed excellent agreement with both the theoretical prediction for Medellín and the high-precision measurement from the Colombian Absolute Gravity Network (RGAC), with a relative error of less than 1%. This close agreement validates the experimental methodology and confirms that even with simple laboratory equipment, meaningful and accurate physical measurements can be achieved when proper uncertainty analysis is applied. Future improvements could include taking multiple measurements of the pendulum length and using electronic timing systems to further reduce human reaction time errors."
