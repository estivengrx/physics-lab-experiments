    "This report details an experiment performed to measure the magnetic field of different magnets using a Hall effect sensor connected to an Arduino. The Hall effect is a physical phenomenon that occurs when an electric current flows through a conductor placed in a magnetic field. This experiment aims to analyze the relationship between distance and magnetic field, using a practical approach and the Arduino platform for data acquisition, specifically testing the decay of the magnetic field with distance experimentally.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hall effect, a physical phenomenon, has been a cornerstone in physics since its discovery in the late nineteenth century. First revealed by the American physicist Edwin Hall in 1879 [1], this effect has become fundamental in numerous technological applications and scientific experiments, playing a role in everyday technological instruments. The Hall effect occurs when an electric current flows through a conductor placed within a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the direction of the current, the consequence of this interaction is the generation of a transverse electric voltage, known as the Hall voltage, which appears perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the electric current. This seemingly simple phenomenon gives rise to a wide range of practical applications and highlights the deep connection between electricity and magnetism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of the Hall effect by Edwin Hall not only expanded our understanding of the relationship between magnetic fields and electric currents, but also opened the door to numerous technological advances. Hall, an experimental physicist, observed this phenomenon while conducting experiments involving electric currents in the presence of magnetic fields. His observation of the lateral deflection of the electric current and the subsequent generation of a transverse potential difference marked the birth of the Hall effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes the Arduino platform and an SS49E Hall effect sensor [2] to move from theory to practical experimentation, the primary objective beign analyzing the physical relationship between distance and magnetic field intensity by measuring the field decay of various magnets. By integrating Arduino with Python for data acquisition, the system converts analog signals into readable units, specifically Gauss (G) and milliTeslas (mT) based on the sensor's sensitivity of $1.4$ mV/Gauss as specified in [2]. Through experimental testing and statistical analysis using metrics such as $R^2$ and Mean Squared Error (MSE), this project seeks to validate the mathematical behavior of magnetic decay. Ultimately, the study aims to confirm whether the experimental data aligns with the theoretical inverse linear function (1/x), providing a deeper understanding of how magnetic fields propagate through space."

    "# Theoretical framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hall effect is a physical phenomenon discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879. This effect appears when an electric current flows through a conductor in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the current flow. As a result, a potential difference is generated, known as the Hall voltage, in the conductor along a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the electric current.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental principles of the Hall effect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lorentz force:** When an electric current flows through a conductor, the moving charges experience a force perpendicular to the magnetic field according to the Lorentz law.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation of Hall voltage:** The Lorentz force causes a separation of charges within the conductor, creating a potential difference known as the Hall voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direction of the Hall voltage:** The direction of the Hall voltage is perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the magnetic field, following the right hand rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of the Hall effect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnetic field sensors:** The Hall effect is used in the manufacture of sensors to measure magnetic fields. Devices based on the Hall effect are highly sensitive and are used in a wide range of applications, from electronic compasses to magnetic switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motor control:** In the automotive industry and other fields, the Hall effect is used in position feedback systems to control the speed and position of motors.\n"

    "## Experimental procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, a system was developed using Arduino and Python code to control and obtain both digital and analog outputs from the SS49E Hall effect sensor (original data can be found in the folders `original_files`, `tests` and `sensor_hall_measurements_G-T`), as well as to transform the measurements provided by the sensor into units such as gauss (G) and millitesla (mT). The procedure was carried out as follows: a digital reading of the sensor was performed to determine whether it detected a magnetic field. If so, an LED was turned on to indicate the presence of the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, an analog reading was taken to obtain a value proportional to the intensity of the magnetic field. However, this value was expressed on a scale determined by the resolution of the Arduino’s analog to digital converter. To convert this value into a more interpretable scale, it was transformed into voltage, considering the Arduino reference voltage of 5 V. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the magnetic field intensity was calculated in gauss using the sensor sensitivity, which has an average value of 1.4 mV/gauss according to the manufacturer (SS49E datasheet, 2019). This transformation allowed the measurement to be expressed in a commonly used magnetic field unit. Finally, the magnetic field intensity was converted from gauss to tesla by applying a conversion constant. This last conversion was essential to comply with the standards of the International System of Units (SI) and to provide a consistent measurement of the magnetic field in internationally recognized units, although in our analysis we used the unit mT for better data interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, measurements were taken at different distances from the Hall effect sensor to the magnets labeled from 1 to 4. The first three magnets were radial ferrite magnets with radii of (0.075, 0.06, and 0.04 ± 0.001) meters, respectively, and the fourth magnet was rectangular."

    "With the aim of experimentally validating this physical phenomenon and the experimental trend shown in Figure 1, we carried out a deeper analysis using Python’s `curve_fit` function. This function allows us to fit our data to different powers of the function 1/x, thus exploring the optimal relationship between distance and magnetic field intensity. By implementing three fits with different powers, we were able to determine more precisely the behavior of the magnetic field as a function of distance."

    "The results obtained from the experiment with the Hall effect sensor provide valuable insight into the variation of the magnetic field of the magnets as a function of the distance to the sensor. The observations and analyses carried out allow the following conclusions to be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the identification of a quadratic trend in the data supports the theoretical expectations based on magnetic theory and prior research. In addition, the experimental analysis performed using Python’s `curve_fit` function facilitated fitting the data to three different powers of the inverse function. This approach provided a detailed understanding of the relationship between distance and magnetic field intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the limitation in the amount of data collected, the linear inverse function 1/x emerged as the best average fit for the four magnets. The consistency of the metrics across the different magnets reinforces the validity and robustness of the methodology used. Furthermore, it highlights the general applicability of the 1/x function to describe the decay of the magnetic field in this experimental context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the findings strongly support the selection of the linear inverse function 1/x as an accurate model for describing the decay of the magnetic field in the experimental setup."
